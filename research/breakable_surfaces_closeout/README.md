# breakable_surfaces closeout evidence

Reproducible evidence for the `_breakable_surface_effect` reconstruction
recorded in `docs/object_matching_logs/breakable_surfaces_obj.md`.

## 2026-08-30 part 2: the origin-mirror source recovery

Commit `fc47f9a15a0aea7f0081394c4d66db5c68ab5323` on the repository's own
`origin` remote (github.com/punpckhdq/halo) contains a
`source/physics/breakable_surfaces.c` from an earlier reconstruction lineage
that preserved the historical topology this repository had lost. It is NOT an
authentic Bungie blob (it carries `match_assert` and a `// TODO: doesn't
match` in its own headers), so it ranks as level-5 hypothesis evidence — but
its shapes were byte-verified here one at a time and all 11 sibling
functions gate strict-exact from its text unchanged.

Verified January shapes recovered from it (all now in production source):

- `real_point2d jitter` in an inner block, both products passed as
  expressions into `point_from_line3d` (explains the never-written
  `[ebp-0x1DC]` frame slot: it is `jitter.y`, elided but allocated);
- `struct new_particle_data particle` declared INSIDE the convex-hull block
  (fixes the particle-vs-temp-cluster frame placement wholesale);
- natural scoping instead of the E09 union: `surface_vertices2d` at while
  scope, `position_2d_test` in the s-loop, `s_normal`/`t_normal` in the
  first-vertex arm, `temp_2d` in the seed arm, `sound_location` plain in the
  epilogue block (the union was a compensating reconstruction device);
- `real u = real_local_random();` in a bare block for the
  `rgb_colors_interpolate` argument;
- `(tint_upper - tint_lower) * real_local_random()` alpha operand order
  (independently derived from the x87 popping form the day before, then
  found verbatim in the mirror);
- `rectangle2d bounds` naming, `real_point3d const *vertex_point` lvalues,
  `fast_ftol(ceil/floor(PIN(...)))` at the four conversion sites.

Two mirror shapes were REJECTED by January's bytes: its
`projection_from_vector3d` helper call (January open-codes the fabs block —
`test ah,1`/`jne` comparisons prove our spelling, and the attested assert
line anchors 266->348 span exactly 82 physical lines only with the
open-coded block) and its shared `bsp3d_get_plane_from_designator`
(January's `jns` at 0x177 proves our private helper's `& LONG_MIN` test).

Line-anchor validation: January's four in-function assert line numbers
(251/266/348/388, attested by the pushed constants in the binary) span
15/82/40 lines; the reconstruction spans 16/82/40 — byte-perfect spans in
the whole body, one line still unaccounted in the declaration head.

## witness_mirror_fast_ftol_20260830.c

Self-contained analysis-only witness (owner rule: no `__asm` in
production).  Under the UNMODIFIED production headers it measures
**20 differing instruction lines** against January -- 1156/1156
instructions, 4032/4032 padded bytes, 117/117 relocations, frame `0x1240`,
and every stack home identical:

```
python tools/campaign/gate.py source/physics/breakable_surfaces \
    --source research/breakable_surfaces_closeout/witness_mirror_fast_ftol_20260830.c \
    --fn _breakable_surface_effect --disas _breakable_surface_effect
```

### CORRECTION (2026-08-30, session 3): the "4 instructions" figure was wrong

An earlier pass in this session reported the witness at 4 differing lines
with a `dot_product3d` spelled `a->i*b->i + (a->j*b->j + a->k*b->k)`, and
claimed the whole-board impact of that header edit was nil.  **Both claims
were false.**  The board check that produced "BOARD IDENTICAL" was run
after the header had already been reverted, so it never tested the edit.

Re-measured properly, with a full `ninja` rebuild between header state and
board:

| `dot_product3d` body | this function | whole board |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `a->i*b->i + a->j*b->j + a->k*b->k` (production, flat) | 20 lines | **277 objects / 4822 fns** |
| `a->i*b->i + (a->j*b->j + a->k*b->k)` (grouped) | 4 lines | 271 objects / 4805 fns — **17 functions lost** |
| k,j,i sequential accumulation | 4 lines | 271 objects / 4787 fns — **35 functions lost** |

Both "fixes" are refuted by tree-wide evidence: they break
`source/math/real_math` itself (79 -> 74 and 79 -> 69 exact functions),
plus objects, items, vehicles and units.  The flat form is *proven* by
those functions.  Any local win from a shared-header edit is meaningless
until the whole board is rebuilt and diffed -- record the board numbers,
not just the local diff count.

The sequential-accumulation form deserved the test: it is the
campaign-proven lever documented in the acceleration playbook (it closed
`collision_prism_test_vector`).  Here it is simply wrong, and the board
says so unambiguously.

### The true residual: five commutative-order sites

All 20 lines are one phenomenon -- VC7 and January order commutative FP
operands/terms differently at five sites, with identical instruction
counts and identical stack homes:

* **Four `plane3d_distance_to_point` expansions** (0x3fc, 0x426, 0x45b,
  0x47f).  Both sides start the sum with the same term; January then adds
  the j term and finally the i term, ours adds i then j.  Example at
  0x3fc: January `fld [-0x1c]; fmul [esi+4]` then `fld [-0x20]; fmul [esi]`;
  ours has those two products in the opposite order.
* **One `cross_product3d` expansion** (0x37b/0x389).  For the two products
  containing `s_normal.k`, January loads the *other* operand
  (`fld [-0x68]; fmul [-0x20]`); ours loads `s_normal.k` first.

### Measured negatives in the TRUE (flat-dot) basin

Micro-probes (`scratch/micro.c`, `scratch/probelab.py`) isolate the tie in
a 96-byte function: `_micro_m6` reproduces our exact behaviour -- products
containing `a.k` left-loaded, all others right-loaded -- so the default
VC7 rule is *right-operand-loaded* and the a.k products are the deviation.
`_micro_m1`/`m2` prove the choice is NOT driven by the definition order of
the two vectors.

Inert (no change to the operand roles): every operand text order inside
`cross_product3d` (VC7 canonicalizes commutative multiply operands),
2-temp vs 3-temp vs direct-to-`result`, decl/init split, named `a->k`
local, named per-product locals, per-component accumulation, negated
components, `scale_vector3d` store order (i,j,k is optimal; every other
permutation is 20-410 lines worse), `plane3d_from_point_and_normal`
argument order / read-`normal`-vs-copy / d-before-n, caller statement
order, nesting the cross into the plane construction, and reversed cross
arguments (13 lines, worse).

### Debugger state (tools/c2dbg32)

`gen_config_cross.py` points dbg32 at the probe compile.  Profiled hit
counts on this path: arena `0x10701000` 26, byte emitter `0x107455e6` 70,
interference test `0x1070943b` 30, preferred-register push `0x1075fa55`
39, width-class write `0x10715873` 53; and **zero** on the mapped FP sites
`0x10745628` / `0x10744304` / `0x10735135`, which were mapped from an
ai_debug compile and do not fire here.  So the FP operand-order decision
is made somewhere not yet mapped; the byte emitter and the allocator are
live and are the anchors for the next search.  `_micro_m6` is the correct
target for that work -- 96 bytes, exhibits the tie, compiles in a second.

## witness_fast_ftol_stack_20260830.json (superseded)

The 2026-08-30 part-1 edit-stack witness against the pre-mirror production
source. Historical: its W3/X1/X2/X3 recoveries are all subsumed by the
mirror topology (X3 verbatim-confirmed, X1 as `real u`, X2 superseded — the
mirror's plain sound test matches January in the new basin; W3 as `jitter`).
